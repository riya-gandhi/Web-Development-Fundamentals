<!-- When the shorthand margin property has two values, it sets margin-top and margin-bottom to the first value, and
margin-left and margin-right to the second value.

The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a
percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, and is usually paired with
the background property which can accept an image as a value

border-left: width style color;

rgba-> a for opacity by alpha channel

Notice that the edges of the shadow are sharp. This is because there is an optional blurRadius value for the box-shadow
property:
box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius color;

<!-- The border of the last fieldset element looks a little out of place. You can select the last element of a specific type

<!-- you will notice the .inline elements are too high on the line.

To combat this, set the vertical-align property to middle. -->
