// mostly when we hear api - it will mean web api but there are more types of api
// when we type a url/uri in browser -> https: a protocol or rule is followed and a request
// is made to the server for eg: http GET which means only data will be read no change 

// http is a stateless protocol that is it does not maintain state -> once a request-response 
// cycle is completed, a new cycle will need to be created

// besides GET, there are more http verbs called REQUEST METHODS

// http headers help us convey data between request ans response -> what does request needs and
// what was response by server like server status codes => eg: 404 page not found means server
// could not find the page which was requested

// REST is a like a protocol for API
// Representational State Transfer

// our request to server is made using http prolly using a library which is stateless : 
// hence if we need to save login state or do something else, all need to be mentioned in
// http headers

// GET      POST        PUT PATCH       DELETE      => http verbs
// Read     Create      Update          Delete      => CRUD Operations
