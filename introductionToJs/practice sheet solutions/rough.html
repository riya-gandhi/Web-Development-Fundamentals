        <p title="Information">Google LLC is an <b>American multinational technology company</b> that focuses on search
            engine
            technology, online advertising, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce,
            artificial
            intelligence,[9] and consumer electronics. It has been referred to as the "most powerful company in the
            world"[10]
            and one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological
            advantages
            in the area of artificial intelligence. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology
            companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. <br><br>

            Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at
            Stanford
            University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of the
            stockholder
            voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in
            2004. In 2015,
            Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary
            and is a
            holding company for Alphabet's Internet properties and interests.

            <br><br><strong>Sundar Pichai</strong> was appointed CEO of Google on October
            24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the
            CEO of
            Alphabet.

            The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many
            of which
            hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail),
            navigation
            (Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace),
            operating
            systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photo), video
            calling (Meet),
            smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Fitbit), gaming (Stadia), music streaming
            (YouTube Music),
            video on demand (TV), artificial intelligence (Assistant), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips
            (TPU), and more.
            Discontinued Google products include Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by
            Gmail.
